      How much disk space you want to allocate to the Storj network.
      
      Be sure not to over-allocate space! Allow at least 10% extra for overhead. If you over-allocate space, you may corrupt your database when the system attempts to store pieces when no more physical space is actually available on your drive. The minimum storage shared requirement is 500 GB, which means you need a disk with at least 550 GB free to allow for the 10% overhead.
